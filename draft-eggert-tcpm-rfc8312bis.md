--- abstract

CUBIC is an extension to the traditional TCP standards. It differs
from the traditional TCP standards only in the congestion control
algorithm on the sender side. In particular, it uses a cubic function
instead of a linear window increase function of the traditional TCP
standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and
long-distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP
congestion control algorithm by Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks. This
document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic
improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work.
Based on the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, it also moves
the specification to the Standards Track.

This documents obsoletes {{?RFC8312}}, updating the specification of
CUBIC to conform to the current Linux version.

# Introduction

The low utilization problem of traditional TCP in fast and
long-distance networks is well documented in {{K03}} and {{?RFC3649}}.
This problem arises from a slow increase of the congestion window
following a congestion event in a network with a large bandwidth-delay
product (BDP). {{HKLRX06}} indicates that this problem is frequently
observed even in the range of congestion window sizes over several
hundreds of packets. This problem is equally applicable to all
Reno-style TCP standards and their variants, including TCP-Reno
{{!RFC5681}}, TCP-NewReno {{!RFC6582}}{{!RFC6675}}, SCTP {{?RFC4960}},
and TFRC {{!RFC5348}}, which use the same linear increase function for
window growth. We refer to all Reno-style TCP standards and their
variants collectively as "AIMD TCP" below because they use the
Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease algorithm (AIMD).

CUBIC, originally proposed in {{HRX08}}, is a modification to the
congestion control algorithm of traditional AIMD TCP to remedy this
problem. This document describes the most recent specification of
CUBIC. Specifically, CUBIC uses a cubic function instead of a linear
window increase function of AIMD TCP to improve scalability and
stability under and long-distance networks.

Binary Increase Congestion Control (BIC-TCP) {{XHR04}}, a predecessor
of CUBIC, was selected as the default TCP congestion control algorithm
by Linux in the year 2005 and had been used for several years by the
Internet community at large. CUBIC uses a similar window increase
function as BIC-TCP and is designed to be less aggressive and fairer
to AIMD TCP in bandwidth usage than BIC-TCP while maintaining the
strengths of BIC-TCP such as stability, window scalability, and RTT
fairness. CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP congestion control
algorithm in Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks, and has been used and
deployed globally. Extensive, decade-long deployment experience in
vastly different Internet scenarios has convincingly demonstrated that
CUBIC is safe for deployment on the global Internet and delivers
substantial benefits over traditional AIMD congestion control. It is
therefore to be regarded as the current standard for TCP congestion
control.

In the following sections, we first briefly explain the design
principles of CUBIC, then provide the exact specification of CUBIC,
and finally discuss the safety features of CUBIC following the
guidelines specified in {{!RFC5033}}.

# Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Design Principles of CUBIC

CUBIC is designed according to the following design principles:

Principle 1:
: For better network utilization and stability, CUBIC
  uses both the concave and convex profiles of a cubic function to
  increase the congestion window size, instead of using just a
  convex function.

Principle 2:
: To be AIMD-friendly, CUBIC is designed to behave like AIMD TCP in
  networks with short RTTs and small bandwidth where AIMD TCP
  performs well.

Principle 3:
: For RTT-fairness, CUBIC is designed to achieve linear bandwidth
  sharing among flows with different RTTs.

Principle 4:
: CUBIC appropriately sets its multiplicative window decrease factor
  in order to balance between the scalability and convergence speed.

## Principle 1 for the CUBIC Increase Function

For better network utilization and stability, CUBIC {{HRX08}} uses a
cubic window increase function in terms of the elapsed time from the
last congestion event. While most alternative congestion control
algorithms to AIMD TCP increase the congestion window using convex
functions, CUBIC uses both the concave and convex profiles of a cubic
function for window growth. After a window reduction in response to a
congestion event is detected by duplicate ACKs or Explicit Congestion
Notification-Echo (ECN-Echo) ACKs {{!RFC3168}}, CUBIC registers the
congestion window size where it got the congestion event as
*W<sub>max</sub>* and performs a multiplicative decrease of congestion
window. After it enters into congestion avoidance, it starts to
increase the congestion window using the concave profile of the cubic
function. The cubic function is set to have its plateau at
*W<sub>max</sub>* so that the concave window increase continues until
the window size becomes *W<sub>max</sub>*. After that, the cubic
function turns into a convex profile and the convex window increase
begins. This style of window adjustment (concave and then convex)
improves the algorithm stability while maintaining high network
utilization {{CEHRX07}}. This is because the window size remains
almost constant, forming a plateau around *W<sub>max</sub>* where
network utilization is deemed highest. Under steady state, most window
size samples of CUBIC are close to *W<sub>max</sub>*, thus promoting
high network utilization and stability. Note that those congestion
control algorithms using only convex functions to increase the
congestion window size have the maximum increments around
*W<sub>max</sub>*, and thus introduce a large number of packet bursts
around the saturation point of the network, likely causing frequent
global loss synchronizations.

## Principle 2 for AIMD Friendliness

CUBIC promotes per-flow fairness to AIMD TCP. Note that AIMD TCP
performs well under short RTT and small bandwidth (or small BDP)
networks. There is only a scalability problem in networks with long
RTTs and large bandwidth (or large BDP). A congestion control
algorithm designed to be friendly to AIMD TCP on a per-flow basis must
operate to increase its congestion window less aggressively in small
BDP networks than in large BDP networks. The aggressiveness of CUBIC
mainly depends on the maximum window size before a window reduction,
which is smaller in small BDP networks than in large BDP networks.
Thus, CUBIC increases its congestion window less aggressively in small
BDP networks than in large BDP networks. Furthermore, in cases when
the cubic function of CUBIC increases its congestion window less
aggressively than AIMD TCP, CUBIC simply follows the window size of
AIMD TCP to ensure that CUBIC achieves at least the same throughput as
AIMD TCP in small BDP networks. We call this region where CUBIC
behaves like AIMD TCP, the "AIMD-friendly region".

## Principle 3 for RTT Fairness

Two CUBIC flows with different RTTs have their throughput ratio
linearly proportional to the inverse of their RTT ratio, where the
throughput of a flow is approximately the size of its congestion
window divided by its RTT. Specifically, CUBIC maintains a window
increase rate independent of RTTs outside of the AIMD-friendly region,
and thus flows with different RTTs have similar congestion window
sizes under steady state when they operate outside the AIMD-friendly
region. This notion of a linear throughput ratio is similar to that of
AIMD TCP under high statistical multiplexing environments where packet
losses are independent of individual flow rates. However, under low
statistical multiplexing environments, the throughput ratio of AIMD
TCP flows with different RTTs is quadratically proportional to the
inverse of their RTT ratio {{XHR04}}. CUBIC always ensures the linear
throughput ratio independent of the levels of statistical
multiplexing. This is an improvement over AIMD TCP. While there is no
consensus on particular throughput ratios of different RTT flows, we
believe that under wired Internet, use of a linear throughput ratio
seems more reasonable than equal throughputs (i.e., the same
throughput for flows with different RTTs) or a higher-order throughput
ratio (e.g., a quadratical throughput ratio of AIMD TCP under low
statistical multiplexing environments).

## Principle 4 for the CUBIC Decrease Factor

To balance between the scalability and convergence speed, CUBIC sets
the multiplicative window decrease factor to 0.7 while AIMD TCP uses
0.5. While this improves the scalability of CUBIC, a side effect of
this decision is slower convergence, especially under low statistical
multiplexing environments. This design choice is following the
observation that the author of HighSpeed TCP (HSTCP) {{?RFC3649}} has
made along with other researchers (e.g., {{GV02}}): the current
Internet becomes more asynchronous with less frequent loss
synchronizations with high statistical multiplexing. Under this
environment, even strict Multiplicative-Increase
Multiplicative-Decrease (MIMD) can converge. CUBIC flows with the same
RTT always converge to the same throughput independent of statistical
multiplexing, thus achieving intra-algorithm fairness. We also find
that under the environments with sufficient statistical multiplexing,
the convergence speed of CUBIC flows is reasonable.

# CUBIC Congestion Control

In this section, we discuss how the congestion window is updated
during the different stages of the CUBIC congestion controller.

~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

### Variables of Interest

Variables required to implement CUBIC are described in this section.

*RTT*:
Smoothed round-trip time in seconds calculated as described in {{!RFC6298}}.

*cwnd*:
Current congestion window in segments.

*ssthresh*:
Current slow start threshold in segments.

*W<sub>max</sub>*:
Size of *cwnd* in segments just before *cwnd* is reduced in the
last congestion event.

starts.

*cwnd<sub>start</sub>*:
The *cwnd* at the beginning of the current congestion avoidance stage,
i.e., at time *epoch<sub>start</sub>*.

W<sub>cubic</sub>(*t*):
The congestion window in segments at time t in seconds
based on the cubic increase function as described in {{win-inc}}.

*target*:
Target value of congestion window in segments after the next *RTT*,
that is, W<sub>cubic</sub>(*t* + *RTT*) as described in {{win-inc}}.

*W<sub>est</sub>*:
An estimate for the congestion window in segments in the AIMD-friendly
region, that is, an estimate for the congestion window of AIMD TCP.

## Window Increase Function {#win-inc}

CUBIC maintains the acknowledgment (ACK) clocking of AIMD TCP by
increasing the congestion window only at the reception of an ACK. It
does not make any change to the fast recovery and retransmit of AIMD
TCP, such as TCP-NewReno {{!RFC6582}}{{!RFC6675}}. During congestion
avoidance after a congestion event where a packet loss is detected by
duplicate ACKs or a network congestion is detected by ACKs with
ECN-Echo flags {{!RFC3168}}, CUBIC changes the window increase
function of AIMD TCP.

CUBIC uses the following window increase function:

~~~ math
\mathrm{W_{cubic}}(t) = C * (t - K)^3 + W_{max}
~~~
{: #eq1 artwork-align="center" }

where t is the elapsed time in seconds from the beginning of the
current congestion avoidance stage, that is,

~~~ math
t = current\_time - epoch_{start}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

and where *epoch<sub>start</sub>* is the time at which the current
congestion avoidance stage starts. *K* is the time period that the
above function takes to increase the congestion window size at the
beginning of the current congestion avoidance stage to
*W<sub>max</sub>* if there are no further congestion events and is
calculated using the following equation:

~~~ math
K = \sqrt[3]{\frac{W_{max} - cwnd_{start}}{C}}
~~~
{: #eq2 artwork-align="center" }

where *cwnd<sub>start</sub>* is the congestion window at the beginning
of the current congestion avoidance stage. *cwnd<sub>start</sub>* is
calculated as described in {{mult-dec}} when a congestion event is
detected, although implementations can further adjust
*cwnd<sub>start</sub>* based on other fast recovery mechanisms. In
special cases, if *cwnd<sub>start</sub>* is greater than
*W<sub>max</sub>*, *K* is set to 0.

Upon receiving an ACK during congestion avoidance, CUBIC computes the
*target* congestion window size after the next *RTT* using {{eq1}} as
follows, where *RTT* is the smoothed round-trip time. The lower and
upper bounds below ensure that CUBIC's congestion window increase rate
is non-decreasing and is less than the increase rate of slow start.

~~~ math
target = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
cwnd                          &
\text{if } \mathrm{W_{cubic}}(t + RTT) < cwnd \\
1.5 * cwnd                    &
\text{if } \mathrm{W_{cubic}}(t + RTT) > 1.5 * cwnd \\
\mathrm{W_{cubic}}(t + RTT)   &
\text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

Depending on the value of the current congestion window size *cwnd*,
CUBIC runs in three different modes.

1. The AIMD-friendly region, which ensures that CUBIC achieves at
   least the same throughput as AIMD TCP.

2. The concave region, if CUBIC is not in the AIMD-friendly region
   and *cwnd* is less than *W<sub>max</sub>*.

3. The convex region, if CUBIC is not in the AIMD-friendly region and
   *cwnd* is greater than *W<sub>max</sub>*.

Below, we describe the exact actions taken by CUBIC in each region.

## AIMD-Friendly Region

AIMD TCP performs well in certain types of networks, for example,
under short RTT and small bandwidth (or small BDP) networks. In these
networks, we use the AIMD-friendly region to ensure that CUBIC
achieves at least the same throughput as AIMD TCP.

The AIMD-friendly region is designed according to the analysis
described in {{FHP00}}. The analysis studies the performance of an
AIMD algorithm with an additive factor of {{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*
(segments per *RTT*) and a multiplicative factor of
{{{β}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*, denoted by
AIMD({{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*, {{{β}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*).
Specifically, the average congestion window size of
AIMD({{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*, {{{β}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*) can be
calculated using {{eq3}}. The analysis shows that
AIMD({{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*, {{{β}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*) with

~~~ math
α_{aimd} = 3 * \frac{1 - β_{cubic}}{1 + β_{cubic}}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

achieves the same average window size as AIMD TCP that uses
AIMD(1, 0.5).

~~~ math
\mathrm{AVG\_AIMD}(α_{aimd}, β_{aimd}) =
    \sqrt{\frac{α_{aimd} * (1 + β_{aimd})}{2 * (1 - β_{aimd}) * p}}
~~~
{: #eq3 artwork-align="center" }

Based on the above analysis, CUBIC uses {{eq4}} to estimate the window
size *W<sub>est</sub>* of AIMD({{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*,
{{{β}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*) with

~~~ math
\begin{array}{l}
α_{aimd} = 3 * \frac{1 - β_{cubic}}{1 + β_{cubic}} \\
β_{aimd} = β_{cubic} \\
\end{array}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

which achieves the same average window size as AIMD TCP. When
receiving an ACK in congestion avoidance (*cwnd* could be greater than
or less than *W<sub>max</sub>*), CUBIC checks whether
W<sub>cubic</sub>(*t*) is less than *W<sub>est</sub>*. If so, CUBIC is
in the AIMD-friendly region and *cwnd* SHOULD be set to
*W<sub>est</sub>* at each reception of an ACK.

*W<sub>est</sub>* is set equal to *cwnd* at the start of the
congestion avoidance stage. After that, on every ACK,
*W<sub>est</sub>* is updated using {{eq4}}.

~~~ math
W_{est} = W_{est} + α_{aimd} * \frac{segments\_acked}{cwnd}
~~~
{: #eq4 artwork-align="center" }

Note that once *W<sub>est</sub>* reaches *W<sub>max</sub>*, that is,
*W<sub>est</sub>* >= *W<sub>max</sub>*, {{{α}{}}}*<sub>aimd</sub>*
SHOULD be set to 1 to achieve the same congestion window increment as
AIMD TCP, which uses AIMD(1, 0.5).

## Concave Region

When receiving an ACK in congestion avoidance, if CUBIC is not in the
AIMD-friendly region and *cwnd* is less than *W<sub>max</sub>*, then
CUBIC is in the concave region. In this region, *cwnd* MUST be
incremented by

~~~ math
\frac{target - cwnd}{cwnd}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

for each received ACK, where *target* is
calculated as described in {{win-inc}}.

## Convex Region

When receiving an ACK in congestion avoidance, if CUBIC is not in the
AIMD-friendly region and *cwnd* is larger than or equal to
*W<sub>max</sub>*, then CUBIC is in the convex region. The convex
region indicates that the network conditions might have been perturbed
since the last congestion event, possibly implying more available
bandwidth after some flow departures. Since the Internet is highly
asynchronous, some amount of perturbation is always possible without
causing a major change in available bandwidth. In this region, CUBIC
is being very careful by very slowly increasing its window size. The
convex profile ensures that the window increases very slowly at the
beginning and gradually increases its increase rate. We also call this
region the "maximum probing phase" since CUBIC is searching for a new
*W<sub>max</sub>*. In this region, *cwnd* MUST be incremented by

~~~ math
\frac{target - cwnd}{cwnd}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

for each received ACK, where *target* is
calculated as described in {{win-inc}}.

## Multiplicative Decrease {#mult-dec}

When a packet loss is detected by duplicate ACKs or a network
congestion is detected by receiving packets marked with ECN-Echo
(ECE), CUBIC updates its *W<sub>max</sub>* and reduces its *cwnd* and
*ssthresh* immediately as below. For both packet loss and congestion
detection through ECN, the sender MAY employ a fast recovery algorithm
to gradually adjust the congestion window to its new reduced value.
Parameter {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>* SHOULD be set to 0.7.

~~~ math
\begin{array}{ll}
ssthresh = cwnd * β_{cubic} &
\text{// new slow-start threshold} \\
ssthresh = \mathrm{max}(ssthresh, 2) &
\text{// threshold is at least 2 MSS} \\
cwnd = ssthresh &
\text{// window reduction} \\
\end{array}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

A side effect of setting {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>* to a value bigger
than 0.5 is slower convergence. We believe that while a more adaptive
setting of {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>* could result in faster
convergence, it will make the analysis of CUBIC much harder. This
adaptive adjustment of {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>* is an item for the
next version of CUBIC.

## Fast Convergence

To improve the convergence speed of CUBIC, we add a heuristic in
CUBIC. When a new flow joins the network, existing flows in the
network need to give up some of their bandwidth to allow the new flow
some room for growth if the existing flows have been using all the
bandwidth of the network. To speed up this bandwidth release by
existing flows, the following mechanism called "fast convergence"
SHOULD be implemented.

With fast convergence, when a congestion event occurs, we update
*W<sub>max</sub>* as follows before the window reduction as described
in {{mult-dec}}.

~~~ math
W_{max} = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
W_{max} * \frac{1 + β_{cubic}}{2}
& \text{if } cwnd < W_{max}, \text{further reduce } W_{max} \\
cwnd
&\text{otherwise, remember cwnd before reduction} \\
\end{array} \right.
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

At a congestion event, if the current *cwnd* is less than
*W<sub>max</sub>*, this indicates that the saturation point
experienced by this flow is getting reduced because of the change in
available bandwidth.  Then we allow this flow to release more
bandwidth by reducing *W<sub>max</sub>* further.  This action
effectively lengthens the time for this flow to increase its
congestion window because the reduced *W<sub>max</sub>* forces the
flow to have the plateau earlier.  This allows more time for the new
flow to catch up to its congestion window size.

The fast convergence is designed for network environments with
multiple CUBIC flows. In network environments with only a single CUBIC
flow and without any other traffic, the fast convergence SHOULD be
disabled.

## Timeout

In case of timeout, CUBIC follows AIMD TCP to reduce *cwnd*
{{!RFC5681}}, but sets *ssthresh* using {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>*
(same as in {{mult-dec}}) that is different from AIMD TCP
{{!RFC5681}}.

During the first congestion avoidance after a timeout, CUBIC increases
its congestion window size using {{eq1}}, where t is the elapsed time
since the beginning of the current congestion avoidance, *K* is set to
0, and *W<sub>max</sub>* is set to the congestion window size at the
beginning of the current congestion avoidance. In addition, for the
AIMD-friendly region, *W<sub>est</sub>* should be set to the
congestion window size at the beginning of the current congestion
avoidance.

## Spurious Congestion Events

For the cases where CUBIC reduces its congestion window in response to
detection of packet loss via duplicate ACKs or timeout, there is a
possibility that the missing ACK would arrive after the congestion
window reduction and the corresponding packet retransmission. For
example, packet reordering that is common in networks could trigger
this behavior. A high degree of packet reordering could cause multiple
events of congestion window reduction where spurious losses are
incorrectly interpreted as congestion signals, thus degrading CUBIC's
performance significantly.

When there is a congestion event, a CUBIC implementation SHOULD save the
current value of the following variables before the congestion window
reduction.

~~~ math
\begin{array}{l}
prior\_cwnd = cwnd \\
prior\_ssthresh = ssthresh \\
prior\_W_{max} = W_{max} \\
prior\_K = K \\
prior\_epoch_{start} = epoch_{start} \\
prior\_W\_{est} = W_{est} \\
\end{array}
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

CUBIC MAY implement an algorithm to detect spurious retransmissions,
such as DSACK {{?RFC3708}}, Forward RTO-Recovery {{?RFC5682}} or Eifel
{{?RFC3522}}. Once a spurious congestion event is detected, CUBIC
SHOULD restore the original values of above mentioned variables as
follows if the current *cwnd* is lower than *prior_cwnd*. Restoring to
the original values ensures that CUBIC's performance is similar to
what it would be if there were no spurious losses.

~~~ math
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
cwnd = prior\_cwnd \\
ssthresh = prior\_ssthresh \\
W_{max} = prior\_W_{max} \\
K = prior\_K \\
epoch_{start} = prior\_epoch_{start} \\
W_{est} = prior\_W_{est} \\
\end{array}
\right\}
\text{if }cwnd < prior\_cwnd
~~~
{: artwork-align="center" }

In rare cases, when the detection happens long after a spurious loss
event and the current *cwnd* is already higher than the *prior_cwnd*,
CUBIC SHOULD continue to use the current and the most recent values of
these variables.

## Slow Start

CUBIC MUST employ a slow-start algorithm, when *cwnd* is no more than
*ssthresh*. Among the slow-start algorithms, CUBIC MAY choose the AIMD
TCP slow start {{!RFC5681}} in general networks, or the limited slow
start {{?RFC3742}} or hybrid slow start {{HR08}} for fast and
long-distance networks.

In the case when CUBIC runs the hybrid slow start {{HR08}}, it may
exit the first slow start without incurring any packet loss and thus
*W<sub>max</sub>* is undefined. In this special case, CUBIC switches
to congestion avoidance and increases its congestion window size using
{{eq1}}, where t is the elapsed time since the beginning of the
current congestion avoidance, *K* is set to 0, and *W<sub>max</sub>*
is set to the congestion window size at the beginning of the current
congestion avoidance.

# Discussion {#discussion}

In this section, we further discuss the safety features of CUBIC
following the guidelines specified in {{!RFC5033}}.

With a deterministic loss model where the number of packets between
two successive packet losses is always *1/p*, CUBIC always operates
with the concave window profile, which greatly simplifies the
performance analysis of CUBIC. The average window size of CUBIC can be
obtained by the following function:

~~~ math
AVG\_W_{cubic} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{C * (3 + β_{cubic})}{4 * (1 - β_{cubic})}} * \frac{\sqrt[3]{RTT^4}}{\sqrt[3]{p^4}}
~~~
{: #eq5 artwork-align="center" }

With {{{β}{}}}*<sub>cubic</sub>* set to 0.7, the above formula is
reduced to:

~~~ math
AVG\_W_{cubic} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{C * 3.7}{1.2}} *
                 \frac{\sqrt[3]{RTT^4}}{\sqrt[3]{p^4}}
~~~
{: #eq6 artwork-align="center" }

We will determine the value of *C* in the following subsection using
{{eq6}}.

## Fairness to AIMD TCP

In environments where AIMD TCP is able to make reasonable use of
the available bandwidth, CUBIC does not significantly change this
state.

AIMD TCP performs well in the following two types of networks:

1. networks with a small bandwidth-delay product (BDP)

2. networks with a short RTTs, but not necessarily a small BDP

CUBIC is designed to behave very similarly to AIMD TCP in the above
two types of networks. The following two tables show the average
window sizes of AIMD TCP, HSTCP, and CUBIC. The average window sizes
of AIMD TCP and HSTCP are from {{?RFC3649}}. The average window size
of CUBIC is calculated using {{eq6}} and the CUBIC AIMD-friendly
region for three different values of *C*.

| Loss Rate P | AIMD | HSTCP | CUBIC (C=0.04) | CUBIC (C=0.4) | CUBIC (C=4) |
| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|
| 1.0e-02 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 1.0e-03 | 38 | 38 | 38 | 38 | 59 |
| 1.0e-04 | 120 | 263 | 120 | 187 | 333 |
| 1.0e-05 | 379 | 1795 | 593 | 1054 | 1874 |
| 1.0e-06 | 1200 | 12280 | 3332 | 5926 | 10538 |
| 1.0e-07 | 3795 | 83981 | 18740 | 33325 | 59261 |
| 1.0e-08 | 12000 | 574356 | 105383 | 187400 | 333250 |
{: #tab1 title="AIMD TCP, HSTCP, and CUBIC with RTT = 0.1 seconds"}

{{tab1}} describes the response function of AIMD TCP, HSTCP, and
CUBIC in networks with *RTT* = 0.1 seconds. The average window size is
in MSS-sized segments.

| Loss Rate P | AIMD | HSTCP | CUBIC (C=0.04) | CUBIC (C=0.4) | CUBIC (C=4) |
| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|
| 1.0e-02 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| 1.0e-03 | 38 | 38 | 38 | 38 | 38 |
| 1.0e-04 | 120 | 263 | 120 | 120 | 120 |
| 1.0e-05 | 379 | 1795 | 379 | 379 | 379 |
| 1.0e-06 | 1200 | 12280 | 1200 | 1200 | 1874 |
| 1.0e-07 | 3795 | 83981 | 3795 | 5926 | 10538 |
| 1.0e-08 | 12000 | 574356 | 18740 | 33325 | 59261 |
{: #tab2 title="AIMD TCP, HSTCP, and CUBIC with RTT = 0.01 seconds"}

{{tab2}} describes the response function of AIMD TCP, HSTCP, and
CUBIC in networks with *RTT* = 0.01 seconds. The average window size is
in MSS-sized segments.

Both tables show that CUBIC with any of these three *C* values is more
friendly to AIMD TCP than HSTCP, especially in networks with a short
*RTT* where AIMD TCP performs reasonably well. For example, in a
network with *RTT* = 0.01 seconds and p=10^-6, AIMD TCP has an average
window of 1200 packets. If the packet size is 1500 bytes, then AIMD
TCP can achieve an average rate of 1.44 Gbps. In this case, CUBIC with
*C*=0.04 or *C*=0.4 achieves exactly the same rate as AIMD TCP,
whereas HSTCP is about ten times more aggressive than AIMD TCP.

We can see that *C* determines the aggressiveness of CUBIC in
competing with other congestion control algorithms for bandwidth.
CUBIC is more friendly to AIMD TCP, if the value of *C* is lower.
However, we do not recommend setting *C* to a very low value like
0.04, since CUBIC with a low *C* cannot efficiently use the bandwidth
in fast and long-distance networks. Based on these observations and
extensive deployment experience, we find *C*=0.4 gives a good balance
between AIMD- friendliness and aggressiveness of window increase.
Therefore, *C* SHOULD be set to 0.4. With *C* set to 0.4, {{eq6}} is
reduced to:

~~~ math
AVG\_W_{cubic} = 1.054 * \frac{\sqrt[3]{RTT^4}}{\sqrt[3]{p^4}}
~~~
{: #eq7 artwork-align="center" }

{{eq7}} is then used in the next subsection to show the scalability of
CUBIC.

## Using Spare Capacity

CUBIC uses a more aggressive window increase function than AIMD TCP
under fast and long-distance networks.

The following table shows that to achieve the 10 Gbps rate, AIMD TCP
requires a packet loss rate of 2.0e-10, while CUBIC requires a packet
loss rate of 2.9e-8.

| Throughput (Mbps) | Average W | AIMD P   | HSTCP P | CUBIC P |
|------------------:|----------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
|                 1 |       8.3 | 2.0e-2  | 2.0e-2  | 2.0e-2  |
|                10 |      83.3 | 2.0e-4  | 3.9e-4  | 2.9e-4  |
|               100 |     833.3 | 2.0e-6  | 2.5e-5  | 1.4e-5  |
|              1000 |    8333.3 | 2.0e-8  | 1.5e-6  | 6.3e-7  |
|             10000 |   83333.3 | 2.0e-10 | 1.0e-7  | 2.9e-8  |
{: #tab3 title="Required packet loss rate for AIMD TCP,
HSTCP, and CUBIC to achieve a certain throughput"}

{{tab3}} describes the required packet loss rate for AIMD TCP, HSTCP,
and CUBIC to achieve a certain throughput. We use 1500-byte packets
and an *RTT* of 0.1 seconds.

Our test results in {{HKLRX06}} indicate that CUBIC uses the spare
bandwidth left unused by existing AIMD TCP flows in the same
bottleneck link without taking away much bandwidth from the existing
flows.

## Difficult Environments

CUBIC is designed to remedy the poor performance of AIMD TCP in fast
and long-distance networks.

## Investigating a Range of Environments

CUBIC has been extensively studied by using both NS-2 simulation and
test-bed experiments covering a wide range of network environments.
More information can be found in {{HKLRX06}}. Additionally, there is
decade-long deployment experience with CUBIC on the Internet.

Same as AIMD TCP, CUBIC is a loss-based congestion control algorithm.
Because CUBIC is designed to be more aggressive (due to a faster
window increase function and bigger multiplicative decrease factor)
than AIMD TCP in fast and long-distance networks, it can fill large
drop-tail buffers more quickly than AIMD TCP and increase the risk of
a standing queue {{?RFC8511}}. In this case, proper queue sizing and
management {{!RFC7567}} could be used to reduce the packet queuing
delay.

## Protection against Congestion Collapse

With regard to the potential of causing congestion collapse, CUBIC
behaves like AIMD TCP since CUBIC modifies only the window adjustment
algorithm of AIMD TCP. Thus, it does not modify the ACK clocking and
Timeout behaviors of AIMD TCP.

## Fairness within the Alternative Congestion Control Algorithm

CUBIC ensures convergence of competing CUBIC flows with the same *RTT*
in the same bottleneck links to an equal throughput. When competing
flows have different *RTT* values, their throughput ratio is linearly
proportional to the inverse of their *RTT* ratios. This is true
independent of the level of statistical multiplexing in the link.

## Performance with Misbehaving Nodes and Outside Attackers

This is not considered in the current CUBIC.

## Behavior for Application-Limited Flows

CUBIC does not raise its congestion window size if the flow is
currently limited by the application instead of the congestion window.
In case of long periods when *cwnd* has not been updated due to the
application rate limit, such as idle periods, t in {{eq1}} MUST NOT
include these periods; otherwise, W<sub>cubic</sub>(*t*) might be very
high after restarting from these periods.

## Responses to Sudden or Transient Events

If there is a sudden congestion, a routing change, or a mobility
event, CUBIC behaves the same as AIMD TCP.

## Incremental Deployment

CUBIC requires only the change of AIMD TCP senders, and it does not
make any changes to AIMD TCP receivers. That is, a CUBIC sender works
correctly with the AIMD TCP receivers. In addition, CUBIC does not
require any changes to the routers and does not require any assistance
from the routers.

# Security Considerations

## Since the Original Paper

CUBIC has gone through a few changes since the initial release
{{HRX08}} of its algorithm and implementation. Below we highlight the
differences between its original paper and {{?RFC8312}}.

- The original paper {{HRX08}} includes the pseudocode of CUBIC
  implementation using Linux's pluggable congestion control framework,
  which excludes system-specific optimizations. The simplified
  pseudocode might be a good source to start with and understand CUBIC.

- {{HRX08}} also includes experimental results showing its performance
  {{and fairness.

<!-- xml2rfc currently doesn't allow the β Unicode symbol in bullet lists -->
- The definition of <!--{{{β}{}}}-->beta*<sub>cubic</sub>* constant
  was changed in {{?RFC8312}}. For example,
  <!--{{{β}{}}}-->beta*<sub>cubic</sub>* in the original paper was the
  window decrease constant while {{?RFC8312}} changed it to CUBIC
  multiplication decrease factor. With this change, the current
  congestion window size after a congestion event in {{?RFC8312}} was
  <!--{{{β}{}}}-->beta*<sub>cubic</sub>* \* *W<sub>max</sub>* while it was
  (1-<!--{{{β}{}}}-->beta*<sub>cubic</sub>*) \* *W<sub>max</sub>* in the
  original paper.

- Its pseudocode used *W<sub>last_max</sub>* while {{?RFC8312}} used
  *W<sub>max</sub>*.

- Its AIMD-friendly window was W<sub>tcp</sub> while {{?RFC8312}} used
  *W<sub>est</sub>*.
